# Python Classes

## Introduction

Classes are blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

They provide a way to model real-world entities and organize code in a structured, reusable manner.
## Key Concepts

Creating a Class:

class ClassName:
*Class body*

Attributes:

  *Data associated with a class and its instances.

  *Defined within the __init__() method (constructor).

Accessed using dot notation: 
  
  *object.attribute

Methods:

  *Functions defined within a class that operate on its data.

  *Also invoked using dot notation: object.method()

Instances:

  *Individual objects created from a class.

  *Each instance has its own unique set of attribute values.
## Additional Features

Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes.

Special Methods: Built-in methods like __str__() and __repr__() for string representation.

Class Attributes: Attributes shared by all instances of a class.
