This repository explores the implementation of various data structures in Python.

## Brief Introduction to Functional Programming Tools

1. Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword, useful for concise operations.

2. Map: Applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the results.

3. Filter: Creates an iterator of elements from an iterable for which a function returns True.

4. Reduce: Applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, often used for aggregation.
